# React Form and React Router Project

This project demonstrates the use of **React Framework** to build dynamic forms and implement routing using **React Router**. The project covers essential features for building a single-page application (SPA) with forms and navigation.

---

## Features

- **Dynamic Forms**: Create and manage forms with validation and dynamic inputs.
- **Routing**: Implemented with React Router for seamless navigation between pages.
- **State Management**: Use of React's built-in state management (hooks) for handling form data and routing state.
- **Reusable Components**: Modular design for form elements and navigation components.
- **Error Handling**: Form validation and route protection.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**:
  - [React](https://reactjs.org/)
  - [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
  - CSS/SCSS for styling
- **Others**:
  - Axios or Fetch API for data submission
  - Context API or Redux (optional for state management)
